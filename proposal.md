Jukebox'd

### What is Jukebox'd
Jukebox'd is a social music discovery platform inspired by Letterboxd but designed for
music lovers. It enables users to share insights, review tracks and albums, and connect
through niche music communities. Our motivation stems from the fragmented nature of
music discussions across social media, where there is no centralized space dedicated to
meaningful music discourse.

With the rise of streaming services like Spotify, users have access to an overwhelming
amount of music, but discovering music that aligns with personal taste remains a
challenge. Jukebox'd addresses this gap by offering a structured yet interactive space for
users to explore, discuss, and curate music

### Customer Value
Target Customer
Music lovers, critics, and casual listeners lack a centralized platform for discovering,
reviewing, and discussing music in a meaningful way. While platforms like Spotify offer
algorithmic recommendations, they do not foster community-driven music exploration.

### Target Audience
● Music enthusiasts who enjoy discovering and sharing music
● Casual listeners looking for recommendations from trusted sources
● Independent artists who want to engage with a music-focused community
● Critics and bloggers who analyze music and trends

### Proposed Solution and Technology

From the user’s perspective, Jukebox'd will deliver:
● A social platform to log, rate, and review music

● Community-driven music discovery via user-generated lists and discussions
● Seamless integration with Spotify’s API for playback and track exploration
Customer Benefits
● A more engaging and community-driven way to discover music

include:
Sprint 1: Core frontend setup,
Sprint 2: Backend development and Spotify API integration
